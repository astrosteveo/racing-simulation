# NASCAR Physics Reference

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-16
**Phase:** Phase 1 - Foundation (Template Created)

---

## Overview

Real NASCAR physics formulas, constants, and specifications gathered through research.

**Source:** Research compiled via Claude Code Explore agent from NASCAR specifications, racing physics publications, and validated racing simulations.

---

## TODO for Phase 2

**Migrate entire content from:** `docs/PHYSICS-REFERENCE.md`

This file will contain:
1. Quick Reference - Key Constants
2. Tire Physics
3. Fuel System
4. Aerodynamics & Drafting
5. Corner Speed & Banking
6. Car Specifications
7. Validation Lap Times
8. Top Speeds by Track Type
9. Implementation Guidelines
10. Sources

**Migration Action:**
```bash
git mv docs/PHYSICS-REFERENCE.md .claude/specs/physics/REFERENCE.md
```

This preserves git history for the file.

**Phase 1 Status:** Template created, awaiting Phase 2 migration
**Phase 2 Action:** Use `git mv` to preserve history
